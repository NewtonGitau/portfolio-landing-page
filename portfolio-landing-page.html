                <p style="font-size: 30px;">Hi there, visitor;<br>
                On this page you'll get to learn about all the attributes <br>
                that make a goal oriented young man such as myself and <br>
                why I'm attending this remote course at <em>Moringa School.</em></p>
            
                <h2>About Me...</h2>
                <p>For as long as I can remember I have been interested in computers and how they worked. <br>
                    This curiosity was coupled withe the need to learn the latest and greatest <br>
                    skill academicaly and also in co-curricular activities.</p>
                <p>For the short period of time I've been learning at <em>Moringa School</em> <br>
                    I've been able to learn:</p>
            <span class="ordered-list">
                <ol>
                    <li><abbr title="Hyper Text Markup Language">HTML</abbr></li>
                    <li><abbr title="Cascading Stylesheet">CSS</abbr></li>
                    <li>Bootstrap</li>
                    <li>Git and GitHub Pages</li>
                </ol>
            </span>
                <p>With the learning material provided via the Moringa School <abbr title="Learning Management System">LMS</abbr>, <br>
                    I've been able to create a few projects and added them to my GitHub <br>
                    repository with multiple commits detailing the tasks done. <br>
                    Here are some of them;</p>
                <ul style="list-style-type: none; font-size:larger;">
                        <li><a href="https://github.com/NewtonGitau/hello-world">Hello World</a> was the first project I ever created with the help <br>
                            and guidance of the LMS. This was web programming with <br>
                            HTML to create a basic web pages.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>Then I created a second web page where I was able to practice hosting on GitHub Pages <br>
                            and how to branch and fork different projects on Git. This project was named <a href="https://github.com/NewtonGitau/webpa9e">webpa9e</a>.<br>
                            The main programming language used in this project was CSS and HTML. </li>
                </ul>
            
                 <p>Through these lessons it's ben possible to challenge <br>
                    myself everyday, and to push myself to do more with <br>
                    my time.</p>               
                <p>As of my education background, learning has always been my forte <br>
                    and through this I've been able to acquire various distinctions <br>
                    from notable universities like <a href="https://www.egerton.ac.ke/">Egerton University</a> where I acquired <br>
                    my undergraduate degree in economics.</p>
                <p>With the evergrowing popularity of online jobs in Kenya, <br>
                    most of the Kenyan youths have found themselves in a gig economy <br>
                    and I'm no different. Over the years online jobs have been my bread <br>
                    and butter. I've been freelancing on a couple of sites <br>
                    where I've been able to hone in on my computer skills. <br>
                    These freelance sites include but not limited to;</p>
